# Remember
#    Do NOT capitalise the first letter in subject line
#    Do NOT end the subject line with a period
#    Do NOT exceed 100 character per line
#
#    Do add TPO id
#    Do use the imperative mood in the subject line
#    Do Separate subject from body with a blank line
#    Do use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#    Do use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
#
# -- Type --
# Must be one of the following:
#
# feat: A new feature
# fix: A bug fix
# docs: Documentation only changes
# style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
# refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# perf: A code change that improves performance
# test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
# build Changes that affect the build system, CI configuration or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
# chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
#
# -- Scope --
# The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example Compiler, ElementInjector, etc.
#
# -- Subject --
# The subject contains a succinct description of the change:
# use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
# don't capitalize first letter
# no dot (.) at the end
#
# -- Body --
# Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
# The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
#
# -- Footer --
# The footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes.
# Breaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
