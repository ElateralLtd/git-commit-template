#
# -- Type --
# Must be one of the following:
#
# feat: A new feature
# fix: A bug fix
# docs: Documentation only changes
# style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
# (white-space, formatting etc)
# refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# perf: A code change that improves performance
# test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
# build: Changes that affect the build system, CI or external deps
# (gulp, broccoli, npm)
# chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
#
# -- Scope --
# The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change.
# For example Compiler, ElementInjector, etc.
#
# -- Subject --
# The subject contains a succinct description of the change:
# use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
# don't capitalize first letter
# no dot (.) at the end
#
# -- Body --
# Just as in the subject, use the imperative,
# present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
# The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast
# this with previous behavior.
#
# -- Footer --
# The footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes.
# Breaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE:
# with a space or two newlines.
# The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
